		<h1>TOP 10 ANIME HEROES</h1>
		<h1></h1>
		<h2>Number 1- Skeet McSpanky</h2>
		<img src="images/Skeet.jpg" alt="Skeet">
		<p>Skeet is a hero. Skeet hired the pretentious Kimmy Neutron and delt with him even though he thought he was smarter than the cash register and called salt sodium chloride in public. After Jimmy destroyed McSpankies, killing thousands of innocent people, all of Sleet's hard work was throw in the garbage. Skeet is a hero we all should strive to be.</p>

		<h2>Number 2- Knuckles</h2>
		<img src="images/Knuckles.jpg" alt="Knuckles">
		<p>Knuckles from Sonic the Headgehog is a hero. He is better than Sonic because Sonic is a greedy, cocky, dumb idiot. </p>
		<p>                               </p>

		<h2>Number 4- Robbie Rotten </h2>
		<img src="images/rob.png" alt="Robbie Rotten">
		<p>Robbie Rotten from Lazy town was the hero everybody needed, but nobody wanted. Robbie was set on introducing a new, more normal and healthy way of life that Sportacus and his little clay trolls didn't want to accept. As a result Robbie Rotten was injured several times by the clay trolls and was never successful in his acts, but will be forever remembered. </p>

		<h2>Number 6- Goddard</h2>
		<img src="images/goddard.png" alt="Sublime Text Logo">
		<p>Goddard is a lost soul that Jimmy Neutron put into a robotic dog. Goddard is a hero because despite being eslaved by Jimmy, he still has a good attitude and puts up with the incompitent child who deems himself as a genius but is realistically a raging sociopath. I hate Jimmy.</p>

		<h2>Number 9- Shrek</h2>
		<img src="images/Shrek.jpg" alt="Shrek">
		<p>Shrek was the black sheep of fairy tell land for being an Ogre, but still did what was best for the magical creatures by saving Princess Feona and allowing them to return to their home.</p>
		<p>                               </p>

		<h2>Number 10- Brenden Fraser </h2>

		<p>The hero we needed, not what we deserve.</p>
